# A Python Web Fuzzer
Creating a basic ffuf in python, basically. All in one file, no crazy extra libraries. Bit slow tho LOL, call it SFUF (slow fuzzer u fool).

Currently supports:
- `-u` for URL
- `-w` for wordlist path
- `-fc` for filtering HTTP status
- `-fs` for filtering HTTP response size
- `-d` for POST data being passed
- `-t` for number of threads
